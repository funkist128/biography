				<h1>Biography</h2>
			</div>
			<p>My  name  is  Chang  Tien  Yu.  Because  my  father's  company  is  related  to  IT  industry,  I've  been  interesting  in  IT  industry  since  I  was  young.  Therefore,  I  choose  Information  Management  as  my  major.

			In  my  college,  the  courses  and  the  teachers  are  really  strict.  Besides  learning  fundamental  theory,  there  are  many  implement  course  and  work  shop.  I  know  more  information  about  realistic  IT  industry  because  of  these  courses.  Sometimes,  some  courses  are  literally  one  project.  I  took  a  course  which  cooperated  with  ESunbank  in  my  fourth  grade.  The  purpose  of  this  course  is  to  complete  a  marketing  project,  including  business  model,  prototype,  and  the  final  presentation.  I  was  responsible  to  design  the  prototype  and  demonstrate  because  I  have  the  ability  of  art  design.Via  this  course,  I  learn  the  most  important  thing  to  carry  out  a  project  is  cooperate  and  communication  with  teammates  and  even  between  teams.  In  conclusion,  I  realize  that  there  is  big  difference  between  school  and  real  working  environment.  However,  I  have  stronger  background  knowledge  and  better  ability  to  communication  with  my  future  teammates  or  co-workers.

			I  am  now  work  as  substitute  military  service  on  Aviation  Police  Bureau.  My  mainly  job  is  do  officers  some  simple  favor.  Although  there  is  no  much  difficult  and  complicated  problems,  I  face  the  real  working  environment.  Therefore,  I  learn  how  to  communicate  with  others  to  find  the  key  problem  and  adapt  the  workplace.

			As  a  freshman,  though  I  don't  have  pretty  record  and  resume,  I  have  enthusiasm  to  learn  new  things.  Besides  doing  my  job  perfectly,  I  won't  let  go  any  chances  to  learn  anything.  Thank  you  for  reading  my  biography,  and  hope  to  talk  to  you  in  person. </p>
